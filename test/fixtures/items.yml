              A projector or image projector is an optical 
              device that projects an image (or moving images) 
              onto a surface, commonly a projection screen. 
              Most projectors create an image by shining a 
              light through a small transparent lens, but some 
              newer types of projectors can project the image 
              directly, by using lasers. A virtual retinal 
              display, or retinal projector, is a projector 
              that projects an image directly on the retina 
              instead of using an external projection screen

              Heading to the beach, or the pool, or the 
              shower? If you want to take your music with you, 
              you totally can with a waterproof speaker - as 
              long as it's got an IP67 rating that is.
              
              We're still waiting for flying cars and 
              near-sentient robot house cleaners, but 
              waterproof and wireless Bluetooth speakers are 
              one device that technology has already delivered 
              on.
